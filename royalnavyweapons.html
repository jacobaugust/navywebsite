	In 1804 a new Pattern Royal Navy Boarding Cutlass (1804P) was introduced. Unlike the swords covered above, this was a crude weapon mass produced for the sailors. It saw service in thousands of small actions, and famous battles like Trafalgar (1805) through to the Crimean War, where sailors used the sword on land and sea. (It was not replaced until 1858 with an innovative model that was also a bayonet.) The design of the predecessor had been popular, so the 1804P was basically the same weapon with improvements. The figure ‘8’ iron hilt was retained but the horn or leather grips were done away with, replaced by an iron grip. Yes, the iron was heavy and would rust, but the old grips actually fell apart from exposure to salt water and humidity, forcing the sailors to improvise with rags and cord. The 1804P was extremely cheap and simple, and the Royal Navy produced countless quantities with many variations of blades, surviving examples ranging from 24 to 29 inches (600 to 750 mm). Through the numerous Royal Navy engagements fought around the world as part of the British Empire building, these cutlasses fell into the hands of other navies.
